                    Difference Between Local Storage, Session Storage?

                    <strong>Local Storage:</strong> This read-only interface property provides access to the
                    Document’slocal storage
                    object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that
                    localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is
                    cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded
                    in a private browsing or incognito session).

                    DOMStrings are storage formats that use UTF-16 to encode data, which uses two bytes per character.
                    Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects. The data stored
                    in LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the document. If the site is loaded over HTTP (e.g.,
                    http://example.com), localStorage returns a different object than if it is loaded over HTTPS (e.g.,
                    https://abc.com).<br>

                    <strong>Session Storage:</strong> Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage
                    read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data
                    does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                    A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are
                    valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the
                    browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created
                    each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is
                    opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage
                    from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and
                    clears sessionStorage objects.

                    <strong>The Global scope:</strong>

                    A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or
                    curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line
                    of code in the program, including inside blocks.<br>

                    <strong>The Block scope:</strong>

                    So far, we’ve seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in the
                    global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to
                    local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.

                    The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if
                    conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect,
                    because the variables are still in the same scope.

                    JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that JavaScript can do only one
                    thing at a single point in time.

                    The JavaScript engine executes a script from the top of the file and works its way down. It creates
                    the execution contexts, pushes, and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution
                    phase.

                    If a function takes a long time to execute, you cannot interact with the web browser during the
                    function’s execution because the page hangs.

                    A function that takes a long time to complete is called a blocking function. Technically, a blocking
                    function blocks all the interactions on the webpage, such as mouse click.

                    As mentioned earlier, the JavaScript engine can do only one thing at a time. However, it’s more
                    precise to say that the JavaScript runtime can do one thing at a time.

                    The web browser also has other components, not just the JavaScript engine.

                    When you call the setTimeout() function, make a fetch request, or click a button, the web browser
                    can do these activities concurrently and asynchronously.

                    The setTimeout(), fetch requests, and DOM events are parts of the Web APIs of the web browser.

                    The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call
                    stack.

                    If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function
                    from the callback queue to the call stack. If the callback queue is empty, nothing will happen:

                    undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial
                    value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.

                    In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this
                    is not the case, avoid overriding it.)

                    A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also
                    returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A
                    function returns undefined if a value was not returned.<br><br>
